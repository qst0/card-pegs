### Example Story (in progress)

In the bathroom...

In my shower I took a `DOSE` of cough syrup that made me feel really funny,

I left the shower to find my sink full of shimmering `DIAMONDS`,

Above the diamonds, in the mirror cabinet was a jewel crusted `DRINK` glass. Fit for a king.

Under the sink, the cabinet door fell off. Revealing a red `HINGE` that glows as if it were hot.

I reach for the door handle to find that the knob has been replaced by an apple `CORE`.

In my room...

On top of my bed, one of my closet `DOOR`s is on top of my bed.

I lift up my bed, removing the door, to find my `DATE` was sleeping in a bed under my bed!

I look over to my open closet, on the right side a phonograph is playing sitting on the `DOCK` on the bay.

** To be Continued when I am bored again. **
